# DM_tweets - Group 11
Development of the project for the Data Mining course a.y. 2022/2023 at University of Pisa. \
More info about the project assignments can be found in `project_description_dm2022.pdf`.

## Setup

To attach the directory containing the dataset, please modify the data path in the `config.py` file.\
This directory will also be used to save all the output `csv` files.

## Repository structure

The repository contains four directories, one for each project task.\
Inside each directory, the notebooks are named by execution order.

## Checkpoints

For simpler data handling, in some points of the analysis, a set of checkpoints has been inserted.
A checkpoint is a point in the code where the state of the data is saved on a different file in order to avoid to re-run
all cells in the notebook.\
If you do not need these intermediate steps, **avoid running these cells** since the dataset is large and takes a
considerable amount of time to be written and read.
